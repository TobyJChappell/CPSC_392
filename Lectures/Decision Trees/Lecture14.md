# Decision Trees
Decision trees are a classification model

When prompted with a question, classify/label based on answer.

## Example
If number of dogs < 5, adopt. Else if number of dogs >=5, do not adopt.

## Structure
First node is called a root node (does not have an input but has an output).

Internal nodes (have both an input and output).

Leaf nodes (have an input but not an output).

## Raw Data -> Decision Tree
Determine what the root node should be
- Find distribution of data for each column to predict goal
- Goal is to find distribution where there is a 0 (pure node)
    * In which, when making a decision, answer prompts only one answer
- Nodes that have distribution > 0 are called impure nodes

Calculate "impurity" value to determine which column should be root node
- Gini score = 1 - Î£(Pi^2) 
- Find weighted average of gini score's of each node to find "impurity"
- Column with lowest "impurity" is the node that should be root

Next goal is to determine where the tree splits using the same method.

Breakfast
- True:
    * Y: 3
    * N: 2
- False:
    * Y: 1
    * N: 3
- Gini score (left node) = 1 - ((3/(3+2))^2 + (2/(3+2))^2) = 0.48
- Gini score (right node) = 1 - ((1/4)^2 + (3/4)^2) = 0.375
- Weighted average = (5/(5+4))\*0.48 + (4/(5+4))\*0.375 = 0.43

Sleep
- True:
    * Y: 3
    * N: 1
- False:
    * Y: 1
    * N: 4
- Gini score (left node) = 1 - ((3/4)^2 + (1/4)^2) = 0.375
- Gini score (right node) = 1 - ((1/5)^2 + (4/5)^2) = 0.32
- Weighted average = (4/9)\*0.375 + (5/9)\*0.32 = 0.34

Professor
- Gini score = 0.48

Use sleep as root for decision tree

Sleep
- True:
    * Breakfast
        - True: 
            * Y: 2
            * N: 0
        - False:
            * Y: 1
            * N: 1
- Gini score (left-left node) = 1 - ((2/2)^2 + (0/2)^2) = 0
- Gini score (left-right node) = 0.5
- Weighted Average (left branch) = 0.25

Sleep
- True:
    * Professor
        - True: 
            * Y: 2
            * N: 0
        - False:
            * Y: 1
            * N: 1
- Gini score (left-left node) = 1 - ((2/2)^2 + (0/2)^2) = 0
- Gini score (left-right node) = 0.5
- Weighted Average (left branch) = 0.25

Since both give the same score, either one is valid.
- Choose Breakfast

Further split on breakfast to try to get pure nodes.

Sleep

                    * N: 0
                - False:
                    * Y: 1
                    * N: 1
