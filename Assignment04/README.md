A winery has hired you to come up with a way to predict a wine's quality using its chemical contents. The quality level goes from 3 (lowest) to 8 (highest). The program fits a logistic regression model on the data to predict wine quality and then displays the accuracy of the model as well as the confusion matrix.

The owner of the winery also wants you to do a binary classification using logistic regression. To do this, the data is split up into good and bad wine qualities (where 5 or below is considered bad and 6 or above is considered good). To evaluate the model, the confusion matrix is displayed in addition to the accuracy, recall, and precision scores.
